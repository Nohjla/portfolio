# Setup local repository, github repository and python environment.

### Steps on creating your local repository

#### First install git on your machine "https://git-scm.com/downloads"
In installing git please refer to the documentaion "https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"

#### After installing we can now use the ff. git command.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git init .                                                  # use to initialize git on the same directory.
git add .                                                   # use to add all modified and added file.
git commit -m "add your comment here"                       # use to commit files.
```

### Steps on creating your github repository

#### If you don't have github account you can visit "https://github.com/" to create an account.
#### On your github left panel click the "New" button.
#### Then write down your repository name then click "Create repository".
#### If yow want to explore the different option on setting your github repository you can refer to github documentation.

> Note: Before you can clone or add remote your github repository please generate new SSH key and add to your github account.

### Creating your python virtual environment on windows.

#### It is very easy to create your python environment just execute this on your command line `python -m venv name-of-your-environment`
#### But before you execute this command i'm expecting that you've already install python on your computer device.

### Now you can add different packages that you need on your python project. On adding packages you can google it on your own.

#### I know that I have a lot to improve in this documentation, I will keep on improving for you guys.
